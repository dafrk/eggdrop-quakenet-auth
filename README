1) Introduction
------

    This is a fairly sophisticated (compared to others) "qauth" script. It
    keeps your eggdrop authed to Q on Quakenet, retrieves the bots auth' 
    chanlevs from Q & L and requests op/invite/unban himself. Ideally, the 
    only thing you'll need to do is set Username + Password and load the script,
    hen (re)start the bot. 

    It will NOT work on other networks than Quakenet. 


2) Installation Instructions
------

a) Download/git-clone qnet.tcl to your scripts directory.

    Only qnet.tcl is needed. If you want easy upgrades, use git to clone the
    repository (optional!):

    $ cd scripts
    $ git-clone git://git.swordcoast.net/irc/eggdrop/quakenet.git qnet
    $ ln -s qnet/qnet.tcl qnet

    You do not have to use git. You can just as well download it manually.

b) Edit your eggdrop.conf to include the following:

        set qnet(user) "authname"
        set qnet(pass) "your-password"
        set qnet(usex) 0
        set qnet(usechallenge) 0
        source scripts/qnet.tcl

    Set usex to 1 to make the eggdrop set +x BEFORE joining any channel.

    Set usechallenge to 1 to use Quakenets CHALLENGEAUTH mechanism. Note
    that this requires the tcl package 'sha1' >= 2.0.0 to be installed.

    On most systems, this is included in the 'tcllib' package; e.g.
        apt-get/aptitude install tcllib

c) Rehash and/or restart the bot.

    If you're rehashing, you might need to do '.qnet auth' on your partyline.
    A restart, however, is recommended.

c) Keeping up-to-date (only applies to git, not for manual download):

    $ cd scripts/qnet
    $ git pull


    That should get you started just nicely. If you're having trouble, do not hesitate
    to mail me.


3) Features
------

a) Channel Flags

    * +noserviceprotect (default: -)
    Stops eggdrop from protecting its channels through Q/L (recover et al)
    * +noserviceop (default: -)
    Stops Q from requesting op through the services.
    * +noservicevoice (default: -)
    Stops Q from requesting voice through the services.

b) Advanced Features

    For all advanced features, please have a look at the script itself; there are 
    various additional settings you can set in your eggdrop.conf; those are documented
    there as well.


4) FAQ
------

    Q My bot always keeps messing about with Q and L and moaning
      about ops/deops.
    A Make sure Q & L are added as global friends & global ops!
      Its not necessary, but recommended to avoid clashes in general.

    Q I am connecting through a bouncer, and eggdrop keeps trying
      to authenticate all the time, even though the server connection
      is already authenticated to Q.
    A This is a known issue. There is no workaround available, except
      setting qnet(authed) to 1, and running qnet:update manually every
      time eggdrop connects:

            set qnet(user) ".."
            set qnet(pass) ".."
            set qnet(usex) ".."
            set qnet(authed) 1
            source scripts/qnet.tcl
            qnet:update

    Q I receive "You're already opped on #channel" on login.
    A This is a issue with eggdrops need-handling. There is no known fix, ignore it.
